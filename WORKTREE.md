## üêõ Known Issues / Tech Debt

### Bugs
- None reported yet (V1 just shipped)

### Tech Debt
- Node.js version warning (Vite requires 20.19+, running 20.18.3) - non-blocking
- No error boundaries in React
- No loading states on async operations
- No offline detection
- No keyboard shortcuts

### Missing Tests
- [ ] Unit tests for parser.ts (extractArguments, substituteArguments)
- [ ] Unit tests for executor.ts (executeSnippet)
- [ ] E2E tests (create ‚Üí execute ‚Üí export flow)
- [ ] Clipboard mocking for tests

## üìä Success Metrics (Track These)

**V1 Goals (First 30 Days):**
- [ ] 10 daily active users
- [ ] 100+ snippets created total
- [ ] 500+ snippet executions
- [ ] 5 users who imported from Raycast

**V2 Trigger (If Hit):**
- 50 users willing to pay $9/month
- 1000+ snippet executions/day
- Feature requests mentioning "teams" or "sync"

**Kill Switch (If Miss):**
- <5 daily users after 30 days ‚Üí quit & next project
- Zero conversions after adding payment ‚Üí pivot or quit

5. [ ] Screenshot the app
6. [ ] Record 30-sec demo video

**Launch Day:**
1. [ ] GitHub repo public

## üí° Feature Requests Template

When users ask for features, triage using this:

**Ship in V1 Patch (Same Week):**
- Critical bugs
- Data loss prevention
- Import/export fixes

**Consider for V2 (After Validation):**
- Sync/cloud features
- Teams/collaboration
- Multi-platform

**Say No To (Politely):**
- Over-engineering (CRDT, custom sync, etc.)
- Features <3 users request
- Anything that delays next ship

## üìù Notes

- **Philosophy:** Ship ‚Üí Learn ‚Üí Iterate
- **Decision Framework:** Would this help 10+ users pay $9/month?
- **Tech Stack:** Keep simple. No fancy state management until pain point.
- **Design:** Copy Raycast. Don't reinvent.

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-04
**Next Review:** After 10 daily users OR 30 days (whichever comes first)
